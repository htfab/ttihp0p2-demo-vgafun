## How it works

It's the digital block from algofoogle's [TT08 VGA FUN!](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt08-vga-fun/) project, with a simple sequencer loop to make it work standalone and some dithering to simulate 8 bit output on the 4 bit Digilent PmodVGA.

## How to test

Plug it into a VGA monitor, reset the project, then sit back and enjoy.

You can also manually select the mode and bit depth if you override the sequencer by pulling bit 7 of the input high.
